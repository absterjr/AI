## [Handwritten Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/absterjr/AI/tree/main/Handwritten%20digit%20recognizer)

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. 
It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many 
different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the 
image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

## [Matplotlib](https://github.com/absterjr/AI/tree/main/Matplotlib)

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

-Create publication quality plots.
-Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.
-Customize visual style and layout.



## [Credit-Scoring-Risk](https://github.com/absterjr/Machine-Learning-and-OpenCV/tree/main/Credit%20Scoring%20Risk)

Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by lenders and financial institutions to determine the ability of a person or a small, owner-operated business to repay. Lenders use credit scoring to help decide whether to extend or deny credit as for any organization, even the slightest chance of financial risk can not be ignored or ruled out. The objective of this challenge is to create a robust machine-learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their historical loan repayment behavior and transactional activities.

## [Oil-Spills-Analysis-and-Solution](https://github.com/absterjr/Machine-Learning-and-OpenCV/tree/main/Oil%20Spills%20Analysis%20and%20Solution)

## Problem


Oil Spills leading to increase in pollution as well as increase in fuel prices.

## Solution


For the first problem where we have to minimize the total repair time we got the below solution - 
With the given constraints and the objective function we got our OPTIMUM SOLUTION as 14361.53 (Total Repair Time). 
Our OPTIMUM VALUE as 2 crews for Simsbury, 5 for Fairfield and 3 for Windsor.


For the second problem where we have to minimize the maximum repair time we got the below solution - 
With the given constraints and the objective function we got our OPTIMUM SOLUTION as 5288.62 (Minimum of Maximum Repair Time). 
Our OPTIMUM VALUE as 1 crew for Simsbury, 6 for Fairfield and 3 for Windsor.

## [Image Editor](https://github.com/absterjr/Machine-Learning-and-OpenCV/tree/main/Open%20CV/Image%20Editor)

This project was created using Python libraries OpenCV and NumPy.
There is a library called OpenCV which provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and has optimized-machine-learning algorithms. It can be used to recognize objects, detect, and produce high-resolution images.

This project is an implementation of Bilateral Filters, Upscaling and Downscaling the image to create blur effects on the image.

Input the file destination in the filename to get the cartoonized image of the desired image.

Next to preserve edges from being decomposed we apply median blur to maintain a vivid color spectrum.

Lastly, we merge two images to generate a cartoonized effect.
