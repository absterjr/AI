Building Python Deep Learning Project on Handwritten Digit Recognition

- Import the libraries and load the dataset
- Preprocess the data
- Create the model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model
- Create GUI to predict digits

We have successfully built a Python deep learning project on handwritten digit recognition app. 
We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective 
for image classification purposes. Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit 
on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.
